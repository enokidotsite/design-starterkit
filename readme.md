<h1 align="center">Enoki / Starter Kit</h1>

The OG starter kit. A little outdated at this point.

## Customization

If you created your site from the Enoki Panel, `cd` to the `source` directory and run `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` for development and `npm run build` for bundling.

To stay up to date, clone the [repository](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-design-vacany) and `git pull origin master` changes.
